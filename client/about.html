          <p>
            I'm a computer engineer and game/XR developer who loves creating
            captivating gaming experiences. In my free time, I enjoy solving
            puzzles like chess and Rubik's cube, and I'm also a speed cuber. I
            have a creative side too, which I express through drawing and
            watching anime. And, I'm a foodie who enjoys trying out new dishes
            and cuisines.
